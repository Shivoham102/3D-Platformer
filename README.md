# 3D-Platformer

This is a game which I made in a course and then added tons of extra features to it like -
1. Adding the Menu screen with the levels menu.
2. Adding various sounds.
3. Adding different textures, effects, skyboxes and objects (from the asset store) for levels with different settings.
4. High score system.
5. Level unlocking as player completes them.
6. Handling saving of points 4. and 5. using PlayerPrefs.
7. Creating an AmbienceController class to handle all the sounds
